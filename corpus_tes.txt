 in submitting captain carter s strange manuscript to you in book form  i believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will be of interest   my first recollection of captain carter is of the few months he spent at my father s home in virginia  just prior to the opening of the civil war   i was then a child of but five years  yet i well remember the tall  dark  smooth faced  athletic man whom i called uncle jack   he seemed always to be laughing  and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged  or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange  wild life in all parts of the world   we all loved him  and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod   he was a splendid specimen of manhood  standing a good two inches over six feet  broad of shoulder and narrow of hip  with the carriage of the trained fighting man   his features were regular and clear cut  his hair black and closely cropped  while his eyes were of a steel gray  reflecting a strong and loyal character  filled with fire and initiative   his manners were perfect  and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type   his horsemanship  especially after hounds  was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen   i have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness  but he would only laugh  and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled   when the war broke out he left us  nor did i see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years   when he returned it was without warning  and i was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment  nor had he changed in any other outward way   he was  when others were with him  the same genial  happy fellow we had known of old  but when he thought himself alone i have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space  his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery  and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens  at what i did not know until i read his manuscript years afterward   he told us that he had been prospecting and mining in arizona part of the time since the war  and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied  as to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent  in fact he would not talk of them at all   he remained with us for about a year and then went to new york  where he purchased a little place on the hudson  where i visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the new york market  my father and i owning and operating a string of general stores throughout virginia at that time   captain carter had a small but beautiful cottage  situated on a bluff overlooking the river  and during one of my last visits  in the winter of       i observed he was much occupied in writing  i presume now  upon this manuscript   he told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate  and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study  telling me i would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity   after i had retired for the night i have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal  i thought at the time that he was praying  although i never understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man   several months after i had returned home from my last visit  the first of march        i think  i received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once   i had always been his favorite among the younger generation of carters and so i hastened to comply with his demand   i arrived at the little station  about a mile from his grounds  on the morning of march          and when i asked the livery man to drive me out to captain carter s he replied that if i was a friend of the captain s he had some very bad news for me  the captain had been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property   for some reason this news did not surprise me  but i hurried out to his place as quickly as possible  so that i could take charge of the body and of his affairs   i found the watchman who had discovered him  together with the local police chief and several townspeople  assembled in his little study  the watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body  which he said had been still warm when he came upon it   it lay  he said  stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff  and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where i had seen him on those other nights  with his arms raised in supplication to the skies   there were no marks of violence on the body  and with the aid of a local physician the coroner s jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure   left alone in the study  i opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me i would find my instructions   they were in part peculiar indeed  but i have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as i was able   he directed that i remove his body to virginia without embalming  and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which  as i later learned  was well ventilated  the instructions impressed upon me that i must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed  even in secrecy if necessary   his property was left in such a way that i was to receive the entire income for twenty five years  when the principal was to become mine  his further instructions related to this manuscript which i was to retain sealed and unread  just as i found it  for eleven years  nor was i to divulge its contents until twenty one years after his death   a strange feature about the tomb  where his body still lies  is that the massive door is equipped with a single  huge gold plated spring lock which can be opened  only from the inside    yours very sincerely   edgar rice burroughs      contents        i  on the arizona hills      ii  the escape of the dead     iii  my advent on
